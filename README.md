# Business Communication

As you can see from the image above about the business communications module I passed with 100% on the quiz. I found the answers through using the module material that was given at the time. The image demonstrates that I learnt enough to pass the quiz that was given with a high mark.

# Interview Skills

The image above clearly demonstrates my ability to learn from the module about interview skills. I managed to score 80% for the quiz that was given and I've been to my own personal job interviews. It taught me alot about how to approach people during an interview and to always be honest.

# Mock Interview

The mock interview is a video of myself answering a few questions relating to an interview setup. It has not been marked yet but based on my experience during job interviews is to be vocal and honest as well as confident. The people hiring you want someone with life and energy who they know will make a good contribution to their business.

# Professional Networking

In the image above I have clearly displayed my ability to learn about professional networking. The quiz is there to show that I have learnt enough of the module to answer a quiz about it. The module taught you how to make connections with people in order to open more doors for an individual.

# Work Etiquette

For the work etiquette module I learnt about how an individual should behave in the work environment as well as taking responsibility. The quiz that was given shows that I passed the quiz with full marks. Being in the workplace before I have learnt about the acceptable and unacceptable things in the work place. Different place will always have different variations of what is acceptable and what isn't.
